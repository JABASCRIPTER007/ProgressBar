# Project "Generator-Consumer"

This project is a web page that demonstrates the interaction between the user, a generator, and electrical consumers. The user can select the type of generator, specify the quantity, choose a consumer, specify the quantity of consumers, and set the working time. The project then calculates the total power of the generator and displays the progress of generator usage using a progress bar.
